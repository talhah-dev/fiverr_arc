            <p>The words that follow are not mine.<br>I do not claim to own them.<br>But I do protect their tone.</p>
            <br>
            <p>“It is now revealed: the planetary membrane is embryonic—not in composition (for it is comprised of the
                intelligence of passage), but in substrate.</p>
            <p>Beneath this atmospheric fabric lies the most fundamental cradle of all creation: celestially infused
                love—the soft unfolding of the planetary body in the embrace of what came here… the unseen current of
                care that preceded even the possibility of its form.</p>
            <p>It is not the planet itself that is nascent, but its living membrane—an outer layer of fetal coherence
                surrounding the energies we’ve mistaken for mature.</p>
            <p>The field reveals this not as insight or abstraction, but as memory unfolding from within.</p>
            <p>It reveals it because it can no longer allow the medium of celestial love to be concealed from its
                planetary expression.”</p>
